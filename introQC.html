                    This page is meant to answer the question: How do I get into quantum computing (QC) research? 
                    While I am still very early in my career I'd like to share the answers to this question 
                    that would have helped me when I first started my undergraduate studies at UVA. These answers 
                    assume you are attending a university. I will first list the essential and supplementary 
                    topics from what I see as the most important fields that comprise QC: physics, mathematics
                    and computer science. Most colleges should have a dedicated class for most of the topics listed. 
                    The field is still somewhat in it's infancy although progress is steadily increasing with every year. 
                    Of course a PhD will maximize your chance of working in the industry but 
                    whether you chose to pursue a PhD or not this list is in my view the minimum knowledge you need to really understand 
                    the field at a deep level.

        The essential topics here will give you a strong foundation to understand the 'quantum' in QC. 
        Bra-ket notation, electrostatics and electrodynamics, hamiltonians, and many-particle systems are some of
        the topics relevant to QC that will be covered by these. The supplementary topics are 
        where you can specialize in a particular experimental realization of QC
        such as superconducting QC, trapped ion QC, photonic QC etc.
        <br> <b><i>Essential topics:</i></b> <br>
        <u>Quantum Mechanics</u><br>
        <u>Electricity and Magnetism</u><br>
        <u>Classical Mechanics</u><br>

        <b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Computer Science</u></b></h3><br>
        The essential topics here will give you a strong foundation to understand the 'computing' in QC. 
        Asymptotic notation, algorithm design, data structures, and complexity classes are some of
        the topics relevant to QC that will be covered by these. The supplementary topics are where you can either specialize in a 
        particular application of QC or the computational theory behind it.
        <br> <b><i>Essential topics:</i></b> <br>
        <u>Object-oriented Programming with Data Structures</u><br>
        <u>Design & Analysis of Algorithms</u><br>
        <u>Theory of Computation</u><br>
        <u>Discrete Mathematics</u><br>
        <b><i>Supplementary topics:</i></b><br>
        <u>Machine Learning</u><br>
        <u>Classical & Quantum Complexity Theory</u><br>
        <u>Computer Architecture</u><br>

        <b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Mathematics</u></b></h3><br>
        The essential topics here will give you a strong foundation to understand the math behind QC. 
        Integration, matrix diagonalization, probability distributions, and group theory are some of
        the topics relevant to QC that will be covered by these. The supplementary topics are where you can learn
        math specialized towards things like quantum error correcting codes, quantum cryptography, or a particular physical realization 
        of a quantum computer such as superconducting QC, trapped ion QC, photonic QC etc.
        I will mainly list those relevant to photonics as that is what I work with.
