                    During my undergraduate and graduate coursework I occasionally found the lectures a bit lacking and found that a good textbook
					would be invaluable for filling in these gaps. This is a list of the best textbooks I found for various courses I've taken throughout my 
					academic career.

        <b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Quantum Mechanics</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
        <b><i>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i> by David J. Griffiths</b><br>
        <b><i>A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics</i> by  John S. Townsend</b><br>
		
		<br><br>
		<b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Quantum Computing & Information</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
        <b><i>Principles Of Quantum Computation And Information: A Comprehensive Textbook</i> by  Giuliano Benenti et al</b><br>
		This is probably my favorite book on quantum information and computing. My undergraduate QC course used the text by Nielsen and Chuang but I wish this was 
		used instead. The Nielsen book is a classic and commonly cited but I found the Benenti book to be much more pedagogical. I usually consult this when
		there <br>
        <b><i>Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing</i> by  Thomas Wong</b><br>
		My second favorite book on quantum information and computing. This book differs from other QC texts as it goes over classical computing concepts as 
		well as QC ones. It was the secondary book for my graduate QC course but was by far the most helpful.

		<b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Statistics</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
        <b><i>A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics</i> by  Ben Lambert</b><br>
		This book saved me in my graduate Bayesian statistics course. When combined with the Youtube lectures Ben made 
		to accompany the book it's a great introduction to Bayesian statistics. <br>

		<br><br>
		<b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Machine Learning</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
		<b><i>The Elements of Statistical Learning</i> by  Jerome H. Friedman et al</b><br>
        <b><i>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</i> by  Christopher Bishop</b><br>

		<br><br>
		<b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Network Science</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
        <b><i>Network Science</i> by Albert-László Barabási and Márton Pósfai</b><br>
        This was the book used in my graduate network science course. Pretty good book and it's freely available online.<br>
		<b><i>Networks</i> by  Mark Newman</b><br>
        
        <br><br>
        <b font-size: 1.6rem;><h3><u>Classical Mechanics</u></b></h3><br>
        <b><i>Favorite texts:</i></b> <br>
        <b><i>Classical Mechanics</i> by John R. Taylor</b><br>
        This was the text used in my undergrad classical mech. course. It was ok but some of the problems are kinda dated. Like what in the world 
        is a plum line??<br>
        <b><i>Introduction to Classical Mechanics</i> by David Morin</b><br>
        I haven't read much of this book but from a cursory look it seems like a better and more modern alternative to the 
        Taylor text. <br>
