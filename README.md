# My Website

This is a repository hosting the code for my personal website. 

The main page contains several visualizers made with javascrip librareis such as D3.js, Three.js & Plotly.js that have the goal of making the concepts more concrete and understandable. Topics covered by the visualizers include:

⋅ Simulated Annealing applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem <br>
⋅ Visualization of the wave function of a particle in an infinite potential well <br>
⋅ Visualization of the motion of a double pendulum with user selected initial conditions <br>
⋅ Visualization of the Riemann Sphere and the projections of various functions onto it <br>
⋅ Visualization of the simple pendulum and its motion with user selected initial conditions <br>
⋅ Visualization of the point group T<sub>d</sub> and its various group elements <br>
